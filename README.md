4. Make your changes
5. Add your files with `git add <filename>` or `git add --all`
6. Commit your changes with `git commit`. Vim will open by default. Type `i` to go into insert mode to begin typing.
    1. Type a commit message in the present tense, less than 50 characters. Some examples are "add header content" or "modified css styles".
